# StudentDash# Student Dash# 🚀 Student Dash - AI-Powered Coding Platform# 🚀 Student Dash - AI-Powered Coding Platform



An AI-powered platform for coding practice and interview prep. Not just another problem tracker — we actually analyze your code and help you improve.



## What makes it different?A platform for tracking coding problems and getting AI-powered feedback on your solutions. Think LeetCode meets intelligent code review.



Most coding platforms count how many problems you solve. We look at *how* you solve them.



Get real-time feedback on:I built this to help students prepare for technical interviews while learning from their mistakes through automated code analysis.> **Track your coding journey. Become a better coder with AI.**> **Track your coding journey. Become a better coder with AI.**

- **Code quality and style** - naming, structure, best practices

- **Security vulnerabilities** - SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets

- **Performance issues** - O(n²) algorithms, memory leaks, inefficient queries

- **Logic and approach** - better algorithms, edge cases you missed## What it does



Then use that feedback to actually get better at coding.



## Features**Question Tracker** - Keep track of problems you've solved across different platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeForces). Add test cases, personal notes, and hints. Mark questions as todo, attempted, or solved.An intelligent coding platform that analyzes your code with ML models, detects security vulnerabilities, and provides personalized learning recommendations.



| Feature | What it does |

|---------|-------------|

| **AI Code Review** | Automatically analyze code for logic errors, performance bottlenecks, security flaws, and style issues using ML models |**AI Code Review** - Submit your solutions and get immediate feedback on:
